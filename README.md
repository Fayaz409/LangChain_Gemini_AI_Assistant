**README Summary: Conversational AI Assistant with Streamlit**

**About**

This project provides a Streamlit-powered conversational AI assistant.  Leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs), it seamlessly engages in chats or task-oriented dialogues based on your provided prompts.

**Key Features**

* **Customizable Prompt Templates:** Tailor the AI's responses by creating your own prompt templates in the sidebar.
* **Conversation History:** The app remembers previous conversations, allowing for a more contextual and continuous interaction.
* **Stylish Interface:**  The included CSS enhances the visual presentation of the chat for a better user experience.

**Getting Started**

1. **Installation:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt 
   ```

2. **Obtain a Gemini API Key:**  Get your API key for accessing the LLM  (Instructions on where to obtain this should be added here).

3. **Environment Variable:** Set an environment variable named `GOOGLE_API_KEY` with your obtained API key.

4. **Run the App:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

**Customization**

* **CSS Styling:** Feel free to modify the CSS file or adjust the styling directly within the Python code to personalize the appearance.
* **Prompts:** Experiment with different prompt templates to guide the AI's behavior and focus the conversation on specific topics or tasks.


**Notes**

* The quality of the AI's responses will depend on the chosen LLM and the clarity of your prompts.
